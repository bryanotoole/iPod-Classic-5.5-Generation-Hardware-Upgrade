<h2>Objective</h2>
To enhance the performance and extend the lifespan of an old iPod Classic by replacing its hard drive with a modern solid-state drive (SSD) and installing a new high capacity battery. By completing this upgrade, this old iPod Classic will have a new life making it a more reliable and efficient music player for years to come.

<h2>Background</h2>
In 2024, its easy to get distracted by the hundreds of notifications we receive everyday across multiple devices. With many people using iPhones as an all in one device, these notifications can seem non-stop from texts, calls, emails, and news updates, to being reminded about that embarrasing teenage Facebook status from 2009.<br />
<br />
While streaming music from Spotify gives easy access to nearly any song imaginable, part of me has been wanting to go back to a time when listening to music was just that - a music that you owned, free from anything else. No ads. No subscriptions. No distractions.<br />
<br />
I thought back to my old iPod Nano I had back in middle school; scrolling through my mix of Akon, T-Pain, and Werid Al Yankovic songs with that oh so satisfying iPod click wheel. Granted, navigating via a touch screen is far more efficient, but picking a song the "old fashion way" of scrolling around a wheel just adds to the retro music experience.<br />
<br />
Wanting to recreate this more pure and nostalgic music listening experience I started researching which MP3 player would give me just that, along with a couple modern upgrades. After going down too many Youtube rabbt holes, I found out the iPod Classic 5th Generation is one of the most easily upgradeable platforms of the entire iPod lineup. While not the most recent of iPod models, the plastic faceplate allows for easy removal compared to the aluminum faceplate of the 6th and 7th generation Classics. The most common upgrades being repalcing the old HDD's with modern SSD solutions, along with installing higher capacity batteries. <br/>
<br/>
I purchased what is unofficially called a *5.5 Generation*, or *5th Generation Enhanced.* This was a mid-year release of the 5th Gen Classic in 2006 that featured an enhanced music chip (Wolfson DAC) and introduced the coveted Search functionality. This feature allowed users to search for songs indidividually instead of scrolling through hundreds or throusands of songs just to find the one song you want to play. <br/>
<br/>
As soon as the iPod and replacement parts arrived I went to work.
