## Objective
To enhance the performance and extend the lifespan of an old iPod Classic by replacing its hard drive with a modern solid-state drive (SSD) and installing a new high capacity battery. By completing this upgrade, this old iPod Classic will have a new life making it a more reliable and efficient music player for years to come.

## Background
In 2024, its easy to get distracted by the hundreds of notifications we receive everyday across multiple devices. With many people using iPhones as an all in one device, these notifications can seem non-stop from texts, calls, emails, and news updates, to being reminded about that embarrasing teenage Facebook status from 2009.<br />
<br />
While streaming music from Spotify gives easy access to nearly any song imaginable, part of me has been wanting to go back to a time when listening to music was just that - a music that you owned, free from anything else. No ads. No subscriptions. No distractions.<br />
<br />
I thought back to my old iPod Nano I had back in middle school; scrolling through my mix of Akon, T-Pain, and Werid Al Yankovic songs with that oh so satisfying iPod click wheel. Granted, navigating via a touch screen is far more efficient, but picking a song the "old fashion way" of scrolling around a wheel just adds to the retro music experience.<br />
<br />
Wanting to recreate this more pure and nostalgic music listening experience I started researching which MP3 player would give me just that, along with a couple modern upgrades. After going down too many Youtube rabbt holes, I found out the iPod Classic 5th Generation is one of the most easily upgradeable platforms of the entire iPod lineup. While not the most recent of iPod models, the plastic faceplate allows for easy removal compared to the aluminum faceplate of the 6th and 7th generation Classics. The most common upgrades being repalcing the old HDD's with modern SSD solutions, along with installing higher capacity batteries. <br/>
<br/>
I purchased what is unofficially called a "5.5 Generation", or "5th Generation Enhanced." This was a mid-year release of the 5th Gen Classic in 2006 that featured an enhanced music chip (Wolfson DAC) and introduced the coveted Search functionality. This feature allowed users to search for songs indidividually instead of scrolling through hundreds or throusands of songs just to find the one song you want to play. <br/>
<br/>
As soon as the iPod and replacement parts arrived I went to work.

## Process

### Preparation:
<p align="left">
I used the iPod for about a week to get used to it and see if I would actually enjoy using a separate device for music before undertaking this project. The iPod came in good condition with a 30GB hard drive and an aftermarket 650 mAh battery from the seller. Original battery capacity for this spec was a 400 mAh from the factory. <br/>

Figure 2 shows the caseback with the unavoidable scratches on the mirror-like stainless steel caseback. While this iPod is 18 years old, these casebacks often looked like this after just 1 month of normal use. <br/>

### Disassembly
<p align="left">
I used box cutter blade to pry the plastic faceplace from the stainless steel back. Once all clips were apart, I disconnected the battery cable from the motherboard to allow for the back to be completely separate from the front half of the unit. <br/>

The original HDD simply folds down away from the motherboard. I removed the yellow clip holding the HDD in and set it to the side. <br/>
